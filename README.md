# JavaArt
This is one of my Java projects. This project shows my skills in making a GUI.

Here, I made a GUI to display randomly generated shapes. It also shows how I am able to randomly generate numbers based off a user's choices. The user is able to adjust the randomness with sliders. They can then regenerate the art with a button. If they like a piece that was generated, they can save it.
